This C++ program helps students parse and display assignment problem lists.

It supports:
- Single problems (such as L6)
- Ranges (such as L1-3)
- Mixed lists with commas and ranges (such as L1-3,5-7)
- Quoted problem set names (such as "Lesson 2" or 'Lesson 2')
- Automatic sorting of problems
- Removal of duplicate problem numbers
- Properly wrapped output lines for readability

Features:

2. Parses input strings with optional spaces (e.g., L 1 - 3 is valid).
3. Handles hyphenated ranges and comma-separated lists.
4. Keeps the problem numbers sorted and without duplicates.
5. Outputs the problem list with commas, "and" before the last item, and line wrapping at ~70 characters.
